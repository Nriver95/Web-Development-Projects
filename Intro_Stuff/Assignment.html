					Originally bred as a hunting dog, the Shiba Inu is among the world’s oldest breeds and one of six native to Japan. A smaller version of the Akita breed, the name Shiba Inu translates as ‘small dog’ in Japanese and it is a Spitz-type breed characterised by its thick coat, pointed ears and curly tail. Known to be a clean dog, Shiba Inu are very loyal and alert with a strong prey instinct and a knack for escaping from gardens. They make a good choice for the experienced dog owner.
