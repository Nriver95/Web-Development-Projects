					What is Monster Hunter?<br><br>
				</h1>
					<article>
						<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter_(video_game)">
							Monster Hunter is an action role-playing video game developed and published by Capcom for the PlayStation 2. The first installment of the Monster Hunter series, it was originally released in Japan in March 2004 and North America in September 2004. A Wii port was released in Japan in April 2009. It was remade and expanded in Monster Hunter G, which was released in Japan and was brought to North America and Europe as Monster Hunter Freedom for the PlayStation Portable.
							<br><br>
							Much of the game can be played offline through single-player. The majority of the content is in the online section of the game. Only some monsters are found in single-player and the player's rewards are smaller (and less valuable) when they are offline. The goal for players online is not to defeat the most monsters but to reach the highest hunter rank, which is the storyline that is carried out online by non-player characters.

					<p>
						Monster Hunter in a nutshell is a game where you roleplay as a Hunter of the Hunters guild that is sent to a village to solve problems that involve the necessity to hunt or slay monsters.  The purpose of this is usually to fix problems where a monster or group of monsters are disrupting the natural eco system surrounding these villages.  The game takes place in many different biomes and each village has a unique theme based on where they are located.
						<br><br>
						For example my favorite generation of Monster hunter is the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation which takes place in the Moga Village.
						<br>

						<br>
						The Moga Village takes place on an island with a tribe of coastal people.
						<br>
						There are many villages that each game is centralized to and they are all different. There are examples of the different villages <a href="#gallery">below</a>.

			<!-- This is a basic description of the gameplay-->
				<section>
					<h1>What is the gameplay like?</h1>
					<p>
						The gameplay of Monster Hunter has evolved over the years but the formula has been pretty consistent. The goal is to accept hunting requests sent by the guild or various villagers and to go out into the different environments the quests take place in to hunt or slay whatever monster is on the request. This is repeated throughout the game until the storyline is completed or you decide that there is nothing left for you to do.  The game is as long or as short as you want it to be.  Some people will just play the missions required to finish the story while other players will grind quests to acquire gear and weapons to complete the content available even after the main story has been completed.
					</p>

					<br><br>

					<h1>Starting off</h1>
					<p>
						In essence you as the player start off at "level 1" with basic armor given to you.  Inside your home is an equipment box that will have a base version of each weapon a hunter is capable of using.  The number of weapons and types depends on the game you are playing and can range from 7 different weapons in the first game to around 14 to 16 in the more recent installments.
					</p>

					<br><br>

					<h1>The weapons</h1>
					<p>
						The type of weapon you use is entirely dependent on you as the player and what play style you enjoy the most.  Down below is a funny playlist which roughly describes most of the weapons and what they do. The videos are meant to be funny but there are plenty of resources online with detailed descriptions on each weapon and how to use them. Some of the weapons resemble regular weapons from our own history while others are cool fantasy constructs that can change and morph into different weapons with different playstyles.<br> Some of the weapons include.
					</p>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Greatsword</li>
							<li>Longsword</li>
							<li>Dual Blades</li>
							<li>Insect Glaive</li>
							<li>Gunlance</li>
							<li>Heavy Bowgun</li>
							<li>Bow</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
					<p>
						There are lots of options for both melee and ranged combat and I recommend trying many weapons to decide which ones are your favorites.
					</p>


					<br><br>

					<h1>The armor</h1>
					<p>
						he armor system isn't too difficult to understand either.  The formula consists of hunting monsters to gain materials.  These materials can be used to craft weapons as well as the armor needed to increase defense.  Each armor piece also provides various skills to improve your hunting abilities and the method of gaining these skills depends on the game played. The game does a pretty good job of explaining everything.
					</p>

					<br><br>

					<h1>The Monsters</h1>
					<p>
						The monsters in Monster Hunter are probably the best part about the game. There is a pretty big variety of monsters to hunt and each one is unique. You will rarely encounter two different monsters that are too similar. They range from giant dragons the size of a mountain to smaller but just as deadly wolf like monsters.  There is a unicorn that can cause thunder storms.  There is a giant snake that resembles the World Serpent, and a silver elder dragon that is essentially a fighter jet.  The variety in combat style and design is where Monster Hunter shines the most and is what keeps me hooked on the series.
					</p>

					<br><br>

					<h1>Ease of access</h1>
					<p>
						One of my favorite things about Monster Hunter is that it is generally easy for new players to come in at any generation and start playing even with no past experience of having played the game before.  The skill floor is very low and the skill ceiling is as high as you want it to be. Even if some quests seem very difficult in the newer generations the developers at CAPCOM have made it very easy to request help from other players who are able to join your game and help you with any hunt you might need help with.
					</p>

					<br><br>

					<h1>Compared to other RPGs</h1>
					<p>
						Although Monster Hunter is an rpg, it does not have any sort of leveling or stat system.  Your defense and attack are entirely dependent on what gear you have and the method to get materials to craft gear is the same for every weapon or armor.

							<h1>Pokke village</h1>
							<p>Pokke Village is the village of the second game.  This is the home base of one of the biggest games Monster Hunter has to offer.  This game introduced a lot of monsters and weapons that have made it through each generations all the way to current day Monster Hunter.</p>

						<div>
							<h1 style="color: skyblue;">Moga Village</h1>
							<p>Moga Village is from the 3rd generation of games and is my favorite generation and village. Moga village introduced underwater combat and a trade system where a ship carrying goods from distant lands would visit and can be bought from using materials acquired from monsters in the game.  Unfortunately underwater combat did not make the cut in future installments of Monster Hunter.</p>

							<p>One of the most recent installments takes place on an unkown frontier known as The New World.  The villages here are comprised of the vast sea faring vessels used to get there having been repurposed into permanent structure for shelter and other things.  All the environments that are explored in this game are isolated from all the other environments one might find in the other games in the series making it the perfect game for newcomers to explore.</p>

						<div>
							<h1 style="color: red;">The Rathalos</h1>
							<p>
								The Rathalos is the most iconic and recognizable monster in the whole series. It is the bread and butter fire dragon of Monster Hunter and has been in every game since the first one.  It is also my favorite monster.  The Rathalos can be found almost anywhere and is usually considered the apex predator.</br>

							<h1 style="color: darkblue;">The Lagiacrus</h1>

						<div>
							<h1 style="color: gold;">The Diablos</h1>
							<p>The Diablos is a large land based wyvern that primarily lives in the desert biome.  The Diablos can burrow under the sand and attack from underneath in an explosion of sand and hate.  One of the most annoying monsters to fight in the series in my opinion.</p>

						</div>
						<div>
							<h1 style="color: black;">The Nargacuga</h1>
							<p>The Nargacuga also known as the pouncing shadow is a black cat like wyvern that primarily lives in the jungle and forest. The Nargacuga is very agile and very fast. It can be difficult to take down if the weapon you are using is slow in nature. the blade wings and hidden spikes on its tail can cause the player to bleed which deals damage over time.</p>
