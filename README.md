Projects using HTML and CSS
I have gone through the HTML and CSS course through The Tech Academy and completed multiple projects.
I have completed projects using just HTML to get the basics down and then later learning how to code and incorporate css into those html assignments. 
I have completed projects using just HTML and writing the styling code on the HTML document itself and later linking seperate css documents to style.
