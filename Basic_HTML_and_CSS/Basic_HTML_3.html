		<div style="color:red; font-family:Arial;">
			 <h2>
			 	When using the div tag the text or elements within the tag will have a contained styling, and anything outside of the tag will have the style set at the beginning of the document.  So instead of the green text we have red.
			 </h2>
		</div>
		<h2>
			This text here, placed outside of the div tag, is reverted back to green. Rather it was never changed to red so it stays green as set in the beginning of this particular document.
		</h2> 
		<p>
			By utilizing the Link tag and referencing the CSS stylesheet I can change the style of this p element to whatever style I want without having to write it into the HTML doc.
