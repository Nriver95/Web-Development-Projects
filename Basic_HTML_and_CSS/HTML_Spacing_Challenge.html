					I wanted to take some time to tell you about my favorite game called "Monster&nbsp;Hunter."<br>
					It's a game that started it's own genre of video game and nothing else can quite mimic it just yet.<br>
					The formula of constant boss battles while simulatneously hunting between zones and the preparation required to complete a quest is a unique one.<br>
					My favorite monster is the <span style="color:red;">Rathalos</span><sup>&#169;</sup> because it is the King of the skies.
